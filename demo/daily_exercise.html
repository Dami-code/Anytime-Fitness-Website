        <h2>Daily Amount of Exercise</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p class="description">
                Exercising on a daily basis is essential for sustaining a healthy lifestyle and meeting long-term fitness objectives. Regular physical activity improves cardiovascular health, builds and maintains muscular mass, and increases energy levels. It also improves mental health by lowering stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.

            <p class="description">
                Consistent exercise aids with weight management by burning calories and improving metabolism. It improves flexibility, balance, and strength, all of which contribute to total functional fitness and injury prevention. Incorporating daily exercise into your routine improves sleep quality and contributes to a happier attitude in life.

                <li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html#:~:text=Recommendations%20for%20adults&text=According%20to%20the%20current%20Physical,and%20vigorous%2Dintensity%20physical%20activity." target="_blank">Resource 1: Daily Exercise Guidelines From The CDC</a></li>
                <p>
                    In the first link, the CDC or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emphasize that adults need 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity a week. Which might sound like a lot at first, but if you were to exercise 30 minutes a day you would fulfill the requirements. Either that or having a 75-minute vigorous activity or an equal mix of moderate and vigorous activities. In combination with at least 2 days of muscle-strengthening would greatly help the majority of adults with their health.

                <p>
                    The second link has a lot of similarities to the first. The Department of Health and Human Services recommends that most healthy adults engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of strenuous aerobic activity per week, spaced out across multiple days. For added health benefits, strive for 300 minutes of moderate activity every week. Strength training for all main muscle groups should be done at least twice a week, with weights or resistance until the muscles fatigue after 12 to 15 repetitions. Incorporating physical activity into your daily routine, even in brief bursts, is helpful, and limiting sedentary time can boost overall health. Regular exercise, whether in long or short sessions, helps to maintain fitness and manage weight.
